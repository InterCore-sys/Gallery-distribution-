💻 Hardware Requirements for Gallery OS
The core requirement is one of the supported Arduino R4 boards:

1. Arduino Board (The cheapest option)

You will need either the Arduino UNO R4 WiFi or the Arduino Nano R4.

Arduino UNO R4 Minima: This is typically the cheapest option within the R4 family. It lacks the built-in Wi-Fi module but has the powerful RA4M1 microcontroller, which is all Gallery OS needs for its core shell and features (Firewall, Password Manager, etc.).

Average Cost: Around $20 USD (Note: Prices fluctuate based on retailer and region).

2. Connection Cable

You will need a cable to connect the Arduino to your computer for programming and to access the serial terminal.

USB-C Cable: The R4 boards use a USB-C port for power and data. Ensure the cable supports data transfer (not just charging).

Average Cost: Around $5 - $10 USD for a basic, reliable cable.

3. Computer

You need a computer (Windows, macOS, or Linux) to program the board and run the Serial Monitor.

Average Cost: $0 (assuming you already own one).

🛠 Software Requirements
These are all free to download and use:

Arduino IDE: The official software environment used to copy, paste, and upload the Gallery OS code (the .ino file) to your R4 board.

Serial Monitor: This tool is built into the Arduino IDE and acts as your terminal window, allowing you to type commands into Gallery OS and see the output.

You must set the Baud Rate to 115200 and the Line Ending to Newline within the Serial Monitor.

The total estimated cost for the cheapest hardware needed is approximately $25 - $30 USD.
